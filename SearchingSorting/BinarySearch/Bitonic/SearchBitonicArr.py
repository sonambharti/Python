'''
Given a bitonic sequence of n distinct elements, and an integer x, 
the task is to write a program to find given element x in the bitonic 
sequence in O(log n) time. 

A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers that is first strictly increasing then after a point decreasing.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = {-3, 9, 18, 20, 17, 5, 1}, key = 20
Output: Found at index 3
